# Dark Mode

Welcome to Dark Mode, an initiative by BYU IT&CSA to introduce essential topics that are necessary to do cool things. We are planning on covering the following topics (order subject to change):

## Fall 2022 Semester

1. Source Control (GitHub) - September 21, 2022
2. Linux - Oct. 5, 2022
3. VSCode - Oct. 19, 2022
4. Raspberry Pi - Nov. 2, 2022
5. Troubleshooting - Nov. 16, 2022
6. Student Choice (Vote) - Nov. 30, 2022

## Winter 2023 Semester

7. January 18, 2023
8. February 1, 2023
9. February 15, 2023
10. March 1, 2023
11. March 15, 2023
12. March 29, 2023
13. May 12, 2023

Most of these topics are not covered well in class until much later in the program (if they are covered at all).

You will notice that there are a few weeks with no topic planned. We would like to take some suggested topics to talk about. We have also created a list of topics we think would be interesting, and will pull some of the topics from this list as well. We try to avoid security and networking related topics as those are already covered very well by the Cybersecurity Student Association and Network Engineering Club. If you are interested in either of those topics, we encourage you to get invloved with those organizations.

* Virtualization
* Containerization
* Server Room/Data Center
* How to Build a Computer
* Internet of Things/Hardware Hacking

Files for these topics can be found in the relevent folder in this repository.
